Title: Model Order Book State Explorer (mobster)
Type: Package
LazyLoad: true
Author: Tom Appleton
Description: A lightweight tool set for modelling exchange orderbook dynamics.
	This package maintains an internal order book following the standard Central Limit Order Book 
	algorithm. It currently supports FAK and GTC type orders.
	Orders can be placed in the book using the 'limit' method and 'market' methods. Quotes could be generated from 
	historical data, or from a statistical model. Executions in the order book and the full orderbook history
	can be obtained for analysis purposes. Trades are modelled as a sequence of ordered events. 
	The main engine was designed to be fast for use with large datasets.
